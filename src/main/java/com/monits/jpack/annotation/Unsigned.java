 * Declare that the field is of an unsigned type.

 * A standard conversion is applied to fit unsigned types in Java's signed types.
 * That is:
 * <ul>
 * 	<li>A short represents an unsigned byte</li>
 *  <li>An int represents an unsigned short</li>
 *  <li>A long represents an unsigned int</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * No other types are supported.
